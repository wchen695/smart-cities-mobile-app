What's the big idea?

I wanted a simple way for anyone to report a problem like a pothole or a downed power line and see it on a map. This app lets you:

File a complaint: The main screen has a big "Report a complaint" button that takes you to a simple form.

Add the details: You can add a description, set how urgent it is ("Very Urgent" for that power line!), and pick the date and time you saw it.

See your history: The "Profile" tab keeps a running list of all the complaints you've submitted.

Check the map: A "Dashboard" shows all the reported issues as pins on a map, so everyone can see what's going on.

What's next?

This is just the first version. I'd love to add features like:

Letting users upload a photo with their complaint.

Adding a comments section to each complaint.

Tapping a map pin to show a full-detail bottom sheet (I've started mocking this up!).

Feel free to fork it, mess with it, and let me know what you think!
